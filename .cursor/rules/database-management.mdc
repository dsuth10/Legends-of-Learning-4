description: Ensure Alembic migration version matches the latest migration to prevent DB version mismatch warnings

- **Always run `alembic upgrade head` after resetting or modifying the database schema**
  - This ensures the database is at the latest migration version and prevents version mismatch warnings like:
    ```
    [DB Version Check] WARNING: DB version <current> does not match latest migration <latest>
    ```
  - **DO NOT** use `db.create_all()` for schema management in production or after initial setup; always use Alembic migrations.
  - If you see a version mismatch warning:
    - Stop the Flask server.
    - Run `alembic upgrade head` in your project root.
    - Restart the Flask server.
  - Keep this as a checklist item after any database reset, migration, or schema change.
